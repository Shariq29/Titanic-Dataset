Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset 🚢
📌 Overview

This dataset is based on the famous Titanic disaster and is commonly used for data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning classification problems.
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various personal and travel-related attributes.

📂 Dataset Description

Each row in the dataset represents a passenger aboard the Titanic, and each column represents a specific attribute.

🔢 Features
Column Name	Description
PassengerId	Unique ID assigned to each passenger
Survived	Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass	Passenger class (1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower)
Name	Passenger name
Sex	Gender of the passenger
Age	Age of the passenger
SibSp	Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch	Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket	Ticket number
Fare	Ticket fare
Cabin	Cabin number (if available)
Embarked	Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
